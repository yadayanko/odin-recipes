        <p> This is a slightly special coffee recipe- 
            with a hint of <em> cinammon!</em></p>
            <p> <h2> Ingredients</h2></p>
            <ul>
                <li> 100grams coffee beans</li>
                <li> Few sticks of cinammon (or ground cinammon) </li>
            </ul>
            <p> <h2>Steps</h2></p>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Prepare Your Beans And Cinnamon Sticks</strong>
                    <p>Grab your beans and measure out as much as you want to grind.
                         Find your cinnamon sticks and snap or cut them with kitchen 
                         scissors into pieces about the same size as a coffee bean. 
                        Any bigger and they won’t grind up properly. 
                    You can also use ground cinnamon if that is what’s available in
                     your pantry. </p> </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Grind Your Coffee Beans And Cinnamon Sticks </strong>
                        <p>Switch your grinder on and inhale. 
    Please take note of your grind settings and 
    make sure it matches your preferred brew method. 
    Refer to this coffee grind chart for more details. 
    Enjoy the heady mix of freshly ground coffee 
    and full-potency ground cinnamon. 
What a rush!</p> </li>

   <strong> Brew The Coffee And Enjoy! </strong>

    <p>Black coffee is ideal for making cinnamon coffee. 
    You can make your coffee with a drip coffee maker, a pour-over brewer, 
    or French press. 
    Brew your coffee with any of the methods above and enjoy!</p> </li>
   <p> <h2> <strong> Extra Notes</strong></h2></p>
    <ul>
 <li> If you grind extra coffee, store it in a vacuum storage container 
     use as needed. </li>
<li> As an alternative, you can make your own creamer with cinnamon 
and add this to your coffee. Or, if you sweeten your coffee,
you can add cinnamon sugar (1) (keep a jar made up for French toast and
 other culinary delights). </li>
<li>If you prefer maple syrup*, 
simply store the bottle with a cinnamon stick in it for an infused flavor. </li>
    </ul>
